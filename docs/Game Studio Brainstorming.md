## Vision Statement
*What is the mission of your solo game studio? How does it align with creating and analyzing innovative game architectures?*

> Round table games is dedicated to creating fun and immersive digital experiences hand in hand with its community. This studio will prioritize communication from all sides of its playerbase and strive to promote interaction between them within its products. This aligns with creating and analyzing innovative game architecture, because it means studying different ways of enacting these goals. The game should be malleable enough that its players can have a say in how it works, but at the same time be balanced and actually function. Not to mention, there are numerous ways of pushing interaction between players that can be utilized. Several ones may have to be studied and tested to find the best for the chosen game design made.

## Unique Selling Point (USP)
*What will make your games stand out from others, particularly in the indie/board game space?*
> [Describe your USP, such as unique mechanics, storytelling integration, or player interaction.]

What would make my game stand out from others in the party game market is that I would like there to be actual strategy to the game. I do not just want a game where a lucky card determines the outcome from the start or a high role on a dice means you just win. I want there to be active decision making going back and forth between friends. Games should be easy to get into and get out of, but I would like the length of the match to scale depending on how the players feel. Maybe they are really getting into it or have had enough and would like to start a new one. Players should play against other players, not ai or luck itself. There should be skill expression to an extent, but I also want the onboarding process of new players to be smooth. Party games typically have stakes as high as the time put into a single match. With one that scales I might not be able to rely on this, so I have decided to make it horror, so the incentive is not to get frightened or jumpscared. I think this will also be pretty different for the party game, couch co-op scene and help it stand out to get some traction.

## Additional Notes
*Include any other ideas, inspirations, or thoughts related to your studio or project.*
> The more interactions between players, the different scenarios they can find themselves in, the more memories I can create, the better the game will be in my opinion and is what I strive for. Creating stories players can talk and tell others about keep people coming back for more.
