#### Goals for this Module
- What does this class entail exactly and what can I expect from it in the future?
- What exactly is a video game at its simplest?
- What does a video game look like in its most complex forms?
- How does my opinion as some who have just played them differ from those who actually make them?
  
#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - This was my first week of class! I think the professor is pretty cool and will make class time fun while also being informative. I learned what a video game is, set up github, talked about the class and got to hear some of the opinions of my peers. I think it was really curious getting to hear everyone's take on the games from my past. I liked all the game references and how we all collectively agreed on the quality of some of those experiences.
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  It is curious to think about. I am not completely sure what I will get out of this class just yet. My friend took it last semester and the professor held a more “just pass the class” mentality. It seems not to be the case this semester. I think I will be actually learning this time around and get to the point where I can make a video game prototype, so I am excited. It is a little worrying being that I was not sure how to setup github, which I imagine will be the simplest part of the class.
- **Solutions**:
  -  My solution was just to watch the professor do it during class. I was looking at the homework and thought I would have to do it on my own. Thankfully that was not the case and we would end up doing it all together. I found this really helpful and a pleasant way to spend class time. I should be good for the time being.

#### Learnings
- I learned today that github is a website that exists because I have never heard of it before. Setting it up was a hassle and seemed rather intimidating when I looked at it by myself, but now I think I get the interface more. I can at least set up a page to fill out dev logs and homework on my own.

#### Free Thinking
- All this behind the scenes stuff might be a little much for me. I am not sure yet, I will have to build up my skills, confidence and understanding of everything as time goes. So I might try to take this class one assignment at a time to not get overwhelmed, while staying on target for due dates.

#### Next Steps
- Go to class next week on time and see what happens. I already have some really good ideas for my game that I think could be done during my time here this semester. I am looking forward to seeing it through.
