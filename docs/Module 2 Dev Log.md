#### Goals for this Module
- Learn about game balance and how it translates to game design and level design
- Discuss with the class examples of good and bad game balance and know why that is
- Understand the thought process behind implementing decision making within games and its importance in maintaining player attention and agency

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - We had a brief discussion about critical hit chance in games, personally I hold the opinion that it is fair as long as everyone is given that chance initially
    - This can then be played into via items or perks
    - Or raw skill like having to aim at specific and hard to hit locations
  - According to the text book, perfect balance is where the player feels all choices are viable (they do not actually have to be that way, just feel like it)
    - Balance ensures no choice is redundant or overpowered 
  - Progress should be from skill/judgement, not from continuous mistakes that yield incremental progress

- **Challenges faced**:
  - We say save points should be a convenience, not a core mechanic (should not be used to break game balance)
    - Do not create a save point in order to get past a game mechanic
    - I have played a number of games that definitely have never heard of this before, putting a horribly difficult challenge right after a save point
      - In my opinion, save points to a degree take away tension from some gaming experiences I have played and I find it really lowers my excitement 
  - It is better to reward correct actions than punish mistakes apparently
    - On average I suppose this is true, it is always interesting though when games decide to break from this mold
  - Some games feel the need to have the player do all the work instead of the machine
    - One example was an ultra realistic war game that makes the player reload like its in real life, otherwise you cannot play the game
  - “When one player gains, the other player should lose” no single option should dominate the decision making process between players
  - Interface must aid not hinder, thats a funny line because I always love to critic game UIs
    - The craziest ones can be kind of funny but the best ones usually are more simplistic than not

- **Solutions**:
  - The three rules of player/game balance are
    - Reward the player (offsets frustration)
    - Let the machine do the work (if action is a “no brainer” let the AI do it)
    - Player plays with the game, not against it

#### Learnings
  - It seems some games with imbalanced positions, balance their game by being able to flip sides and give who ever had the disadvantage before the advantage 
  - I learned that random occurrences in games are rarely ever purely spontaneous
  - I now know what an abstract game is and that some people hold the opinion that symmetry within them insults player intelligence
  - I learned giving players the agency to to adopt to new strategies and not relying on dominant ones keeps the game interesting and investing to play
  - Design should be scalable, making it easier to add elements and update in the future
  - Symmetry in game design means the choices at players disposal should functionally be the same
  - Balance is an art and science, it takes time and practice to master and fully understand

#### Free Thinking
I have been thinking about my game prototype for the semester and what I want it to look like. I had two really interesting ideas, one that takes inspiration from a game I recently played.
> I have been playing a game called routine in my spare time. It is a horror game that takes place onboard an abandoned space ship where there is some sort of overgrowth spreading a blight among the crew (I haven’t finished it yet). In one section of the game you are being chased by an entity that can only be seen through your hand held device.
> I have referred to this device as an ipod, because it is about the same shape and size. It’s a really scary moment. You have to navigate these tight corridors and if you hear the entity, you have to pull up this tiny camera to figure out their exact location. This shift in perspective is a really fun game mechanic.
> Another thought that has crossed my mind is that I wanted the prototype to be a small horror couch co-op game, similar to that of the luigi mansion game from nintendo land on the wii u. I really liked playing that with my friends all the time when we were younger. It is kind of a top down, isometric view, looking from above on a cast of characters.

#### Next Steps
> My idea for the week is to merge these two ideas, one from my horror experience and the other as my original inspiration. Have players normally look down on a maze-like game board before switching perspective, likely first person in this case, to provide more insight on the game space around them, before switching back to top down. This will be my main game mechanic. The actual game, interaction, incentive and goals will come later down the road.
